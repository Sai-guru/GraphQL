Perfect â€” letâ€™s break down your `index.ts` line-by-line, explaining **every word and concept**, from top to bottom.

---

### ðŸ”¹1. **Imports**

```ts
import express from 'express';
```

* **`express`** is a minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* `import express from 'express'` means:

  * Weâ€™re importing the **default export** from the `'express'` module.
  * `express` is actually a **function**, and calling it creates an app object (`const app = express()`).

---

```ts
import { ApolloServer } from "@apollo/server";
```

* **ApolloServer** is the main class from Apollo to create a GraphQL server.
* Comes from the `@apollo/server` package (v4+).
* It takes a schema (typeDefs + resolvers) and handles GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

---

```ts
import { expressMiddleware } from "@apollo/server/express4";
```

* This connects ApolloServer with Express (via middleware).
* `expressMiddleware(server)` wraps the server so Express can route `/graphql` requests to Apollo.

---

```ts
import cors from "cors";
```

* CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* This is an Express middleware that allows APIs to be accessed from different origins (e.g., your frontend on a different port or domain).

---

```ts
import { typeDefs, resolvers } from "./schema.js";
```

* We are importing the GraphQL schema and logic:

  * `typeDefs`: defines types, queries, mutations, subscriptions (as a string).
  * `resolvers`: functions that resolve each type/query/mutation/subscription.

---

```ts
import { createServer } from "http";
```

* Node.js built-in module.
* Needed to create a **raw HTTP server** (so we can attach WebSocket to it).
* Express can run over this raw HTTP server.

---

```ts
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws";
```

* A WebSocket server from the `ws` package.
* It allows us to receive WebSocket connections on the same HTTP server (`httpServer`).

---

```ts
import { useServer } from "graphql-ws/use/ws";
```

* `graphql-ws` lets us handle **GraphQL subscriptions** over WebSockets.
* `useServer({ schema }, wsServer)` attaches the GraphQL subscription handler to the WebSocket server.

---

```ts
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
```

* Combines `typeDefs` and `resolvers` into a single `schema` object.
* Required by both Apollo and `graphql-ws`.

---

### ðŸ”¹2. **Async Server Start Function**

```ts
const startServer = async()=> {
```

* Declares an `async` function to set up and run everything (so we can use `await` inside it).

---

### ðŸ”¹3. **Express App Setup**

```ts
  const app = express();
```

* Creates an Express app instance.

```ts
  const PORT = 4000;
```

* Sets a fixed port number for your server to listen on.

---

### ðŸ”¹4. **HTTP + WebSocket Server Setup**

```ts
  const httpServer = createServer(app);
```

* Converts the Express app into a Node.js HTTP server.
* This is required because WebSocket needs access to the **raw HTTP layer**.

---

```ts
  const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });
```

* Combines GraphQL `typeDefs` and `resolvers` into a usable GraphQL schema.

---

```ts
  const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
      server: httpServer,
      path: '/graphql'
  });
```

* Creates a WebSocket server on the same port and same path (`/graphql`).
* `path` must match the GraphQL endpoint.

---

```ts
  useServer({ schema }, wsServer);
```

* Binds the GraphQL WebSocket server (`graphql-ws`) to the WebSocket server (`wsServer`).
* Now you can receive real-time **subscriptions** on this server.

---

### ðŸ”¹5. **Apollo Server Setup**

```ts
  const server = new ApolloServer({ schema });
```

* Instantiates a new ApolloServer using the combined schema.

---

```ts
  await server.start();
```

* Starts the ApolloServer. This must happen before applying the middleware.

---

### ðŸ”¹6. **Apollo Middleware on Express**

```ts
  app.use('/graphql', cors(), express.json(), expressMiddleware(server));
```

This line configures middleware stack for Express route `/graphql`:

1. **`cors()`** â€” Allows cross-origin access.
2. **`express.json()`** â€” Parses incoming JSON requests.
3. **`expressMiddleware(server)`** â€” Handles GraphQL queries, mutations via HTTP POST.

---

### ðŸ”¹7. **Start Listening**

```ts
  httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    console.log(`ðŸ“¡ Subscriptions ready at ws://localhost:${PORT}/graphql`);
  });
```

* This actually starts the server.
* You see two logs:

  * One for HTTP queries/mutations.
  * One for WebSocket subscriptions.

---

### ðŸ”¹8. **Call the start function**

```ts
startServer();
```

* Runs the function immediately when this file is loaded.

---

### âœ… Summary Flow

1. Express app is created.
2. HTTP server is created from the app.
3. WebSocket server is attached to that HTTP server.
4. `graphql-ws` listens for subscription events.
5. ApolloServer listens for HTTP requests.
6. Middleware stack is applied.
7. HTTP server is started.
